v0.6.86.8 Alpha
Build 06867

opposed to each thread making their own connections.

v0.6.86.7 Alpha
Build 06867
- Changed:  server database update function will now also update mac_addr
field.
- Added: more clarification to gc status code 2-4 by DCron script.
- Added: 'Critical Error' state (code 3) for gc state.
- Changed: Tweaked DCron script to log when an error occurs with DCron.

v0.6.86.6 Alpha
Build 06866
- New: Started Writing SQL statements for Rafael's frontend to parse DB.
- Fixed: issue where 3ware-based r-servers were not correctly reporting
their number of hard drives at AMS2/LAX
- Fixed: DCron script's gc server querying - script now no longer always
reports gc as not running, now accurately reports GC as running.
- Fixed: issue where old spool fill states were still showing up in DCron's
query of spool fill percentage, resulting in script always reporting code 3
for recovery state.
- Fixed: issue where DCron did not have a proper condition for 'defunct' - also
fixed issue where serial class interpreted "not running but spools not full"
(code 3) as 'defunct'. DCron now transmits code 4 for 'defunct' recover state,
and serial class now accurately reflects this.
- Disabled: drive reporting interpretation/database insertion for the short
term until mutex locking/thread queues are implemented.
- New Issue: - #0001 - Spool fill percentage and var fill percentage are not being
reported correctly by DCron
- New Issue: - #0002 - program throws segfaults sporadically when server
reports come in.
- New Issue: - #0003 - program exits without error sporadically when server
reports come in.
- New Issue: - #0004 - logger class writes all previously flushed but not
written messages since last write on buffer flush and write, regardless of
message level.
- New Issue: - #0005 - Double Free or corruption error still occurs every so
often when reading from an instance of std::map.
- New Issue: - #0006 - Double Linked List Corruption error occurs sporadically
on database insertions.
- New Issue: #0007 - Database connections exceeding mysql max connection
limit, causing new connections to fail. Should be fixed with mutex locking.
